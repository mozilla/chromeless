The `content` module exports three different traits [Loader], [Worker] and
[Symbiont]. None of this traits is intended to be used directly by programs.
Rather, they are intended to be used by other modules that provide high
level APIs to programs or libraries.

[Loader]:#module/api-utils/content/loader
[Worker]:#module/api-utils/content/worker
[Symbiont]:#module/api-utils/content/symbiont
