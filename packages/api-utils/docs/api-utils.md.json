Your module can implement this recommendation using the\n`publicConstructor` function.\n\nOptions objects or \"dictionaries\" are also common throughout the high-level\nAPIs.  The guidelines recommend that public constructors should generally define\na single `options` parameter rather than defining many parameters.  Since one of\nthe SDK's principles is to be friendly to developers, ideally all properties on\noptions dictionaries should be checked for correct type, and informative error\nmessages should be generated when clients make mistakes.  With the\n`validateOptions` function, your module can easily do so.\n\nAnd objects are sometimes iterable over a custom set of key/value pairs.\nSuch objects should have custom iterators that let consumers iterate keys,\nvalues, or [key, value] pairs.  The `addIterator` function makes it easy to do\nso in a way that is consistent with the behavior of default iterators during\n`for...in`, `for each...in`, and `for...in Iterator()` loops.\n\n"], ["api-json", {"line_number": 32, "name": "publicConstructor", "returns": {"line_number": 52, "type": "function", "description": "A function that makes new instances of `privateConstructor`.\n"}, "params": [{"line_number": 55, "required": true, "type": "constructor", "name": "privateConstructor", "description": ""}], "signature": "publicConstructor(privateConstructor)", "type": "function", "description": "Returns a function *C* that creates an instance of `privateConstructor`. *C*\nmay be called with or without the `new` keyword.\n\nThe prototype of each instance returned from *C* is *C*.`prototype`, and\n*C*.`prototype` is an object whose prototype is\n`privateConstructor.prototype`.  Instances returned from *C* are therefore\ninstances of both *C* and `privateConstructor`.\n\nAdditionally, the constructor of each instance returned from *C* is *C*.\n\nInstances returned from *C* are automatically memory tracked using\n`memory.track` under the bin name `privateConstructor.name`.\n\n**Example**\n\n    function MyObject() {}\n    exports.MyObject = apiUtils.publicConstructor(MyObject);\n"}], ["markdown", "\n\n"], ["api-json", {"line_number": 58, "name": "validateOptions", "returns": {"line_number": 96, "type": "object", "description": "A validated options dictionary given some requirements.
