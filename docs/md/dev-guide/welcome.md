# Welcome to the Chromeless Toolkit! #

Chromeless is designed to make it easy to build standalone desktop
applications using only web technologies.  It has features that 
make it possible to safely embed and manage web content, and has
a goal of making it possible to implement a complete web browser.

Chromeless includes:

* a set of ***modules*** providing high-level JavaScript APIs which you can use
to write your application.

* a set of ***tools*** for running, testing, and packaging applications

For a high level introduction to chromeless you might want to spent a 
few minutes with our [screencast overview].
