## Prerequisites ##

To develop with Chromeless, you'll need:

<span class="aside">

* [Python] 2.5 - 2.7, note that versions 3.0 or greater are not
  currently supported.

* A Windows XP or later OS, linux (32 or 64 bit), and intel OSX 10.5 or newer

* The [Chromeless] toolkit. 

  [Chromeless]: http://github.com/mozilla/chromeless

## Installation ##

You can attain the latest version of the chromeless toolkit as
a [tarball] or a [zip file], or you can clone the source
[from github]

Chromeless is designed to be completely self contained, and to fetch
the specific versions of dependent software it needs upon first run.
So installation consists only of fetching the software.

  [tarball]: https://github.com/mozilla/chromeless/tarball/master
  [zip file]: https://github.com/mozilla/chromeless/zipball/master
  [from github]: http://github.com/mozilla/chromeless

## Sanity Check ##

To ensure that chromeless is functional, simply run the default
example:

  $ &lt;path to chromeless&gt;/chromeless

You should see a simple web browser pop up, if so, you're ready to 
jump into the [tutorial](#guide/tutorial-first-app).
