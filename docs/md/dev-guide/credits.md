Chromeless is possible because of the [XULRunner] and [addon-sdk]
projects, both of which have a long list of contributors.  We'd like
to thank both of those projects and their contributors for being
awesome, as well as the following list of contributors who have
directly helped build chromeless:

  [XULRunner]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xulrunner
  [addon-sdk]: https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk

<span class="aside">
  Because measuring the value of contributions is intractable,
  let's just be lexicographic about this.
