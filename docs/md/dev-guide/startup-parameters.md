## Configuring App Parameters

There are a number of basic parameters that can be changed to customize
your applications basic behavior.  These include your app's icon,
name, initial window size and characteristics, and more.  These parameters
are controlled by placing a JSON configuration file in the directory where 
your application code resides.  The file should be named `appinfo.json`.
