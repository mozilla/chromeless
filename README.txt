Jetpack SDK README
==================

This a work-in-progress implementation of the Jetpack SDK. It should
not be confused with the Jetpack Prototype, which is an entirely
different project.

Before proceeding, please make sure you've installed Python 2.5
or later if it's not already on your system:

  http://python.org/download/

To get started, first enter the same directory that this file is
in using a shell program. On Unix systems or on Windows with MSYS,
you can execute the following command:

  source bin/activate

Windows users using cmd.exe should instead run:

  bin\activate.bat

Then run:

  cfx docs

This should start a documentation server and open a web browser
with further instructions.
